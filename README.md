This web application was developed as an additional contribution of my masters (2014-2016). It was developed using mainly Javascript and JQuery. Its main goal is allowing network operators to manage an SDN Network. This application, which resides in the Application plane of the SDN architecture, accesses the RESTful API exposed by the Floodlight Controller in order to gather the topology, flows, network statistics, etc. Inside the directory there is a video showing some features of the application.
